DEPLOYING GAMEFI TO NETLIFY FROM GITHUB
========================================

PREREQUISITES
-------------
- GitHub repository with your code pushed
- Netlify account (free at netlify.com)


STEP 1: PUSH TO GITHUB
----------------------
If not already done:

  git push origin main


STEP 2: CONNECT TO NETLIFY
--------------------------
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Click "Add new site" > "Import an existing project"
3. Select "GitHub" as your Git provider
4. Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub account
5. Select your "gamefi" repository


STEP 3: CONFIGURE BUILD SETTINGS
--------------------------------
Netlify should auto-detect Next.js, but verify these settings:

  Build command:        npm run build
  Publish directory:    .next

For Next.js 16+, Netlify uses the Next.js Runtime automatically.


STEP 4: DEPLOY
--------------
1. Click "Deploy site"
2. Wait for the build to complete (2-5 minutes)
3. Your site will be live at a random URL like:
   https://random-name-123456.netlify.app


STEP 5: CUSTOM DOMAIN (OPTIONAL)
--------------------------------
1. Go to Site settings > Domain management
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow DNS configuration instructions


AUTOMATIC DEPLOYMENTS
---------------------
After initial setup, every push to your main branch will
automatically trigger a new deployment.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (IF NEEDED)
---------------------------------
1. Go to Site settings > Environment variables
2. Add any required variables
3. Redeploy for changes to take effect


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Build fails:
- Check build logs in Netlify dashboard
- Ensure package.json has correct build script
- Verify all dependencies are listed

API routes not working:
- Netlify Functions handle Next.js API routes automatically
- Check Functions tab in Netlify dashboard for logs

Page not found errors:
- Netlify handles Next.js routing automatically
- If issues persist, add a netlify.toml file (see below)


OPTIONAL: netlify.toml
----------------------
Create this file in your project root for explicit configuration:

  [build]
    command = "npm run build"
    publish = ".next"

  [[plugins]]
    package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
